# CSV and TTL Documentation

Definitions for **`ttl_log_*`** (columns here; mapping table § below) plus **`phase*_*.csv`**, **`debrief`**, **`summary`**.

**Elsewhere:** run sheet (**`script.md`**); stimuli + timings + **`phase2_trial_order.csv`** (**`TASK_DESCRIPTION.md`**); repo bootstrap / example filenames (**`README.md`**).

## TTL Log (ttl_log_{participant}_{datetime}.csv)

Every TTL trigger is logged with timestamp, trigger code, event label, and trial info. Written incrementally as each event occurs. The file is initially created as `ttl_log_{datetime}.csv` (before participant name is known), then renamed to include the participant at task end.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `timestamp` | Float (Unix) | Time when TTL fired |
| `trigger_code` | String | Event identifier (same as event_label unless overridden) |
| `event_label` | String | Human-readable event name |
| `trial_info` | String | Optional trial metadata (e.g., trial=3, shape=Shape_0_1.png) |

**Event types**: See TTL Trigger Mapping below.

For **fixed-duration** segments, `*_onset` fires immediately **before** the first `flip()` of that segment and `*_offset` immediately **after** the last frame (after `_wait(duration)`). Instruction screens additionally log `*_enter` on keypress. On Phase 2 question trials, **`phase2_response`** is logged immediately before **`phase2_question_offset`** (response TTL, then epoch end).

---

**Historical:** Older `ttl_log` files may still list `phase1_instruction2a_*` / `phase3_instruction2a_*` (participant-paced “expect to see” prompts; no longer emitted).

## TTL Trigger Mapping

Trigger codes equal event labels (strings). Use these for EEG/fMRI analysis. Phase 1 & 3: **Click** to move, **Enter** to submit. Each click logged as `click_place` (trial_info: click=N).

## File Saving

- **Location**: `../LOG_FILES/`
- **Filenames**: `{basename}_{participant}_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}.csv` or `.png`
- **Test participants**: Name contains "test" → no files written (TTL log deleted)

Example filenames: **README.md** → Data output.
