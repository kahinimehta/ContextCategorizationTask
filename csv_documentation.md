# CSV and TTL Documentation

Reference for all CSV outputs and TTL triggers. **Example files (repo root):** `README.md` (Data output → Example output). **Experimenter script:** `script.md`. **Technical spec:** `TASK_DESCRIPTION.md`.

## TTL Log (ttl_log_{participant}_{datetime}.csv)

Every TTL trigger is logged with timestamp, trigger code, event label, and trial info. Written incrementally as each event occurs. The file is initially created as `ttl_log_{datetime}.csv` (before participant name is known), then renamed to include the participant at task end.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `timestamp` | Float (Unix) | Time when TTL fired |
| `trigger_code` | String | Event identifier (same as event_label unless overridden) |
| `event_label` | String | Human-readable event name |
| `trial_info` | String | Optional trial metadata (e.g., trial=3, shape=Shape_0_1.png) |

**Event types**: See TTL Trigger Mapping below.

## TTL Trigger Mapping

Trigger codes equal event labels (strings). Use these for EEG/fMRI analysis. Phase 1 & 3: **Click** to move, **Enter** to submit. Each click logged as `click_place` (trial_info: click=N).

## Phase 1 CSV (phase1_{participant}_{datetime}.csv)

Per-shape data from the bottom-up shape classification phase.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `shape_path` | String | Full path to the shape image file |
| `final_x` | Float | Final x position in screen coordinates (height units) |
| `final_y` | Float | Final y position in screen coordinates (height units) |
| `rt` | Float | Reaction time from clickable onset to last click (seconds). At least one click required before Enter. |
| `stimulus_onset_ttl` | Float | Reserved (currently empty); use ttl_log for stimulus onset timestamp |
| `stimulus_offset_ttl` | Float | Reserved (currently empty); use ttl_log for stimulus offset timestamp |
| `click_ttl` | Float | TTL timestamp at last click to place |
| `all_click_ttl` | String | Semicolon-separated timestamps of all clicks (Unix) |
| `submit_ttl` | Float | TTL timestamp when participant pressed Enter to submit |

---

## Phase 2 CSV (phase2_{participant}_{datetime}.csv)

Per-trial data from the top-down context incorporation phase. **64 trials** per session. Trial order and stimuli match **`phase2_trial_order.csv`** in the task root row-for-row (`trial` 1…64 = template row order).

**Template (`phase2_trial_order.csv`):** Header plus 64 rows. Columns: `trial_number`, `shape`, `shape_path`, `strong_context`, `neutral_context`, `context1`, `context1_image`, `context2`, `context2_image`, `variant`. The task loads stimulus paths and `variant`; `strong_context` / `neutral_context` are not read by the script (design labels only). Paths may be absolute or relative to `STIMULI/`. Variants: `original`, `context_swapped`, `control_context`, `control_context_swapped`. Full template semantics: **TASK_DESCRIPTION.md** (Phase 2 trial template).

**Note:** TTL columns `fixation_onset_ttl` through `question_onset_ttl` are reserved but currently written empty; use `ttl_log` for full event timestamps. Only `response_ttl` is populated.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `trial` | Integer | Trial number (1–64; same order as rows in `phase2_trial_order.csv`) |
| `shape_path` | String | Full path to the shape image |

| `context_2_path` | String | Full path to second context image |
| `trial_variant` | String | original, context_swapped, control_context, control_context_swapped |
| `response` | String | Button clicked: category A or B (e.g., BARK, CLOUD) |
| `rt` | Float | Reaction time from question onset to button click (seconds) |
| `fixation_onset_ttl` | Float | TTL at fixation onset (see note above) |
| `context1_onset_ttl` | Float | TTL at context 1 onset |
| `shape_onset_ttl` | Float | TTL at shape onset |
| `reddot_onset_ttl` | Float | TTL at red dot onset |
| `context2_onset_ttl` | Float | TTL at context 2 onset |

---

## Phase 3 CSV (phase3_{participant}_{datetime}.csv)

Same structure as Phase 1 (including click_ttl = last click, all_click_ttl = all clicks). Per-shape data from the post-context shape reclassification phase. Shape order is randomized differently from Phase 1.

---

## Placement Images (phase1_placements_*.png, phase3_placements_*.png)

PNG images of final shape placements at the end of Phase 1 and Phase 3. White canvas with each shape drawn at its final (x, y) position. Saved only for non-test participants.

| `onset_ttl` | Float | TTL timestamp at question screen onset |
| `response_ttl` | Float | TTL timestamp at Yes/No button click |

**Questions:**
1. "Did you use the same grouping strategy as the first time you sorted these shapes?"
2. "Did the images associated with each shape you saw influence your grouping the second time around?"
3. "After thinking about how shapes might fit in different environments, did you find yourself interpreting the shapes differently when you sorted them the second time?"

---

## Summary CSV (summary_{participant}_{datetime}.csv)

Overall experiment summary.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `participant_id` | String | Participant identifier |

## File Saving

- **Location**: `../LOG_FILES/`
- **Filenames**: `{basename}_{participant}_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}.csv` or `.png`
- **Test participants**: Name contains "test" → no files written (TTL log deleted)

**Examples in the repository:** Filenames and file list: **README.md** (Data output → Example output).
